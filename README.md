# PoLitmus

> This project was made as a part of our **DES101: Introduction to human-computer interaction** course under Prof. Indrani De Parker at IIIT Delhi in Winter'22
semester.

PoLitmus is a Political Social-media platform that will facilitate easy & smooth
communication b/w political representatives & public. Here the politicians
would be able to put forward their goals & ideologies all in one place and reach
out to the public. In contrast, the public can mention their demands and
suggestions for upcoming/existing governmental policies. Moreover, there
would also be provisions for the public to track the progress of promises made
by their leader. Thus, it'd reduce the gap b/w leaders & public, which is
essential for a healthy & functioning democracy.

Also, since it'd be an exclusive political app, it'd reduce the amount of political
fuss on other existing SM platforms and help them stick to their cause!

While making this app, we went through all the process that real world companies go through while making a commercial application. The final report pdf is attached, which
comprises of the **summary** of our whole iteration process as well as the lo-fi, mid-fi and hi-fi prototype of the app made using **Figma**.

Thank you for coming here :blue_heart:
